# SQL-DB-Healthcare-Data-Management-System
The aim of this project is to design and develop a database for the hospital to maintain the records of all patients, and their appointments with doctors, departments, rooms, etc. in the hospital. It also maintains details of usual patient visits, patients being admitted to the hospital, operated patients, and their discharge.

"All patients must have a valid insurance policy on file in order to receive treatment. If a patient does not have a valid insurance policy, they must pay for their treatment in full at the time of service." 

This business rule ensures that patients are properly insured and that the healthcare provider is able to receive payment for the treatment they provide. It also ensures that the patient is aware of any financial obligations they may have before they receive treatment. 

Other potential business rules for a healthcare management system might include: 

•	All patients must provide a valid government-issued ID when checking in for treatment. 
•	All medical records must be kept confidential and secure, and can only be accessed by authorized personnel. 
•	Patients must provide at least 24 hours' notice for any appointment cancellations or rescheduling. 
•	Prescription medication must be dispensed in accordance with the prescribing physician's instructions and any applicable laws and regulations. 
•	Patients must provide their insurance information before receiving treatment. 
•	Insurance claims must be submitted within a certain timeframe (e.g., 30 days) to be eligible for reimbursement. 
•	Patients must be notified of any changes to their treatment plan. 
•	Healthcare providers must have a valid license to practice. 
•	Patients must be given the option to consent to or decline treatment. 
•	Healthcare providers must maintain confidentiality and protect the privacy of patient information. 
•	Patients must be given the option to designate a healthcare proxy or power of attorney. 
•	Patients must be provided with information about the risks and benefits of any proposed treatment. 
•	Patients must be given the option to request a second opinion from another healthcare provider. 
•	Healthcare providers must report any adverse events or incidents to the appropriate authorities.

These business rules help to ensure that the healthcare management system operates efficiently, effectively, and in accordance with legal and ethical standards.
